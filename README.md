# BadWrAPI - a C++ wrapper for the undocumented Badoo API
Demo application and wrapper class made in Qt/C++ as a proof of concept
on how to connect to the Badoo network from a desktop program.

Contains reverse-engineered #define's taken from the mobile apps Badoo,
Bumble and the now-defunct Blendr.

Getting involved
----------------

I'm open to criticism and suggestions. Feel free to [send me](mailto:quark1482@protonmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20BadWrAPI) your comments. :slightly_smiling_face:

To code purists, I advocate for standards and code conventions. But I also love\
structured code **with all my heart**.
